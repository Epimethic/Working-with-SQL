# Working-with-SQL
This task required me to write and test my SQL code using the W3School's SQL browser IDE.

In this task I had to write the SQL code to create a table called Student with the following attribute names and data type:
STU_NUM        CHAR(6)
STU_SNAME      VARCHAR(15)
STU_FNAME      VARCHAR(15)
STU_INITIAL    CHAR(1)
STU_STARTDATE  DATE
COURSE_CODE    CHAR(3)
PROJ_NUM       INT(2)

Once the table was created and the relevant data inputted, then I had to manipulate the data.

student.txt shows the SQL code that was used.
